**About me**
======
Hello! Welcome to my personal blog.

I am currently a senior university student (2021.09-2025.06) in the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University in China.

My interest lies in distributed system, including Blockchain principles and consensus mechanisms. Besides, I am also interested in the intersection between **artificial intelligence** and **distributed system**.
