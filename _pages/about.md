**❗️ About me**
======
Hello! Welcome to my personal blog.

I am currently a senior university student in the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University in China. I am expected to graduate in June 2025.

My interest lies in **distributed system**, including Blockchain principles and consensus mechanisms. Besides, I am also interested in the intersection between **artificial intelligence** and **distributed system**.
